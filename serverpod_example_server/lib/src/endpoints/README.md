# Configure and add endpoints

Here is the place where we configure out endpoints. To create an endpoint we need to extend the `Endpoint` class from Serverpod. Each endpoint holds methods which we can call to retrieve information from the database.

## Todo Endpoint

1. Create a `todo_endpoint.dart` file
2. Declare the `TodoEndpoint` class
3. Configure our methods to do simple CRUD operations

The generated `Todo` object from our `todo.yaml` file holds factory methods, which are used to communicate with the database.
